# Rock'n Paper & Scissors

This is a beginner javascript recap project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/rock-paper-scissors). 
The goal is to build a simple rock, paper and scissors game in Javascript to play in the browser console. 

In this version, a simple GUI is added, so that the user can play in the browser.
